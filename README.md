## The Business
Stone Signs is a Sussex based company that provides a signage service for estate agents for property that is on the market For Sale or To Rent.  They also provide signage for commercial property as well as event sponsorship.  
In January 2020, Stone Signs launched an on-line Portal to enable estate agents to manage their sign request needs, and for Stone Signs to use as a work scheduling tool.
Since conception, and up to the end of August 2021 the Portal has registered and actioned over 29,000 requests.  The data collated has been used in a series of analyses to reveal insight into Stone Signs’ operational practices to help provide recommendations for improving the business and ultimately increase revenue.
To compliment this area of the property market, data from the HM Land Registry relating the price paid for property in 2020 and 2021 has also been sourced.
